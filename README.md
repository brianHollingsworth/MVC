# MVC
Just some examples of my work with Models, Views, and Controllers.

## ASP.NET Core MVC
Even though I'm a lifelong Apple fan boy, I still find great admiration for the recent work Microsoft has done with the open source community. Checking out their cross-platform web framework is one way for me to remain impartial in the eternal Mac vs. PC battle.

### MvcMovie: A movie management web app built using ASP.NET Core MVC on Windows with Visual Studio
While waiting for an offshore resource during a late-night deployment, I felt like checking out some online tutorials. I decided upon Microsoft's [Getting Started with ASP.NET MVC 5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/adding-controller?view=aspnetcore-2.1), because I actually had a new project coming up that I wanted to build using the latest and greatest patterns and platforms.

A fair amount of code was generated by Visual Studio's ASP.NET Core Web Application template; however, any comment beginning with "\d+.)" is an annotation for the code I wrote for a particular section of the tutorial.
